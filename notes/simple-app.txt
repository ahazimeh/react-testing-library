Transformers
For styles to be interpreted in tests, you need a transformer to, well, transform the CSS classes into styles. Here are a couple options:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-transform-css

https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-css-modules-transform

The latter has more downloads per week, but the former seems to be more actively maintained.
