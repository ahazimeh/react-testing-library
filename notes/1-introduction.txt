React Testing Library provides virtual dom for tests
Jest is a test runner

render method creates a virtual dom and you access it with the screen global object

toHaveLength

// jest dom
toBeInTheDocument()
toBeVisible()
toBeChecked()

react testing library helps with rendering component into virtual dom
helps searching the virtual dom
interacting with the virtual dom

TDD: write the test before writing the code
then write the code to make the test pass
it is called red green testing

makes a difference on how testing feels
rather than doing a humen testing then run the tests, you can know what is wrong because the tests are already written

Acceptance / End to end tests(E2E): Cypress, Selenium

Functunal testing tests behaviours: such as when the user enters invalid data the input turns red
